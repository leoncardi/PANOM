# PANOM

The PANOM — Proxy-based Attention Network Optimization Model constitutes an early-stage inferential framework in initial prototyping, planned for operational deployment in performance optimization within social-media environments governed by opaque recommender systems. The framework relies on the use of attention proxies derived from observable performance metrics (e.g., retention rate, engagement velocity, interaction frequency) as indirect estimators of algorithmic prioritization signals.

PANOM includes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) mechanism for the reconciliation of potentially competing performance indicators (e.g., reach, engagement, conversion), enabling data-driven decision support in commercial content operations. The planned implementation involves progressive parameter adjustment based on historical account-level data, with the objective of performance stabilization and improvement under real-world operational constraints.

Status: pre-implementation stage; conceptual model under active specification; no empirical validation to date; open-science intent (AGPL-3.0); project nomenclature reserved for future releases.
